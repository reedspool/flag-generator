# Flag Generator

Creative coding exercise - generate a flag on every load.

When you click on a component of the generated flag, it regenerates swapping in just that component for another.

Future: Encode the values for all the primitive visual elements instead of the high level components, or use a seeded random number generator and encode the seed, in order to make random components consistent
